Aristotle Platform / Admin
==============================

Aristotle is a work in progress.
The goal of Aristotle is to be an open source commerce platform for growing businesses. We have a ways to go, but figured it useful to begin making our progress publically available.

Aristotle is being built on [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor), so we can't express our gratitude enough for all that the Meteor team has done. They make our job that much easier.

All functionality is handled in local meteor pacakges. These packages will potentially be broken out into seperate repos in the future. Some features (and packages) currently in progress:

- Products
- Orders
- Invoices
- Reports
- Transactons
- Uploader
- Validation
- Coupons
- Components (various UI components)
- Tags (for categories, relationships, etc)
- Content (for general collections)
