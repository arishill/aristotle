Arishill Commerce Admin (Web)
==============================

Arishill Commerce is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for production use, as most features are not in a complete workable state. This repo is for the Web Admin of the platform.

The goal of Arishill Commerce is to be an open source commerce platform for growing businesses. We aim to create something that is flexible and easy for developers to use.

We have a ways to go, but figured it useful to begin making our progress publicly available.

### Preview
Below is a screenshot of the products index view to give an idea of what's in store for the Commerce Admin.

Arishill Commerce Admin is being built on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) server-side and [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org/) client-side. It will utilize the Arishill Commerce API. You can learn more how the API will work by checking out our [API Docs](https://arishill.com/docs).

### Features
Some feature currently in progress:

- Products
- Orders
- Invoices

### History
The first version of Arishill Commerce was written in PHP back in 2011-2012. It is currently being used in production by several boutique clients.

This open source version of Arishill Commerce, will be built on the same premise, but is a complete re-design and re-write in NodeJS improving the first iteration in many ways.
