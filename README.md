Aristotle is a work in progress.
The goal of Aristotle is to be an open source commerce platform for growing businesses. We have a ways to go, but figured it useful to begin making our progress publically available.

Aristotle is being built on [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor). with various functionality handled in meteor pacakges. These packages will potentially be broken out into seperate repos in the future.
