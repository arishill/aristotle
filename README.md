Aristotle Platform
==============================

Aristotle is a work in progress.
The goal of Aristotle is to be an open source commerce platform for growing businesses. We aim to create something that is flexible and easy for developers to use.
We have a ways to go, but figured it useful to begin making our progress publically available.

### Design Preview
Below is a sampling of designs of the dashboard, products index, and invoice edit page to give an idea of what's in store.

### Tech
Aristotle is being built on [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor), so we can't express our gratitude enough for all that the Meteor team has done. They make our job that much easier.

### Features
All functionality is handled in local meteor pacakges. These packages will potentially be broken out into seperate repos in the future. Some features (and packages) currently in progress:

- Products
- Orders
- Invoices
- Reports
- Transactons
- Uploader
- Validation
- Coupons
- UI Components
- Tags
- Content (for general collections)

### History
The first version of Aristole was written in PHP back in 2012. It is currently being used by several boutique clients including:

[French Garment Cleaners](frenchgarmentcleaners.com)
*Boutique in Brooklyn, NY*

[Spina NYC](spinanyc.com)
*Flower Shop/Event Services Company in New York, NY*

[Gwen Penn](gwenpenn.com)
*Character shop selling art prints*

This open source version of Aristotle, will be a complete re-design and re-write in MeteroJS improving the first iteration in many ways.
