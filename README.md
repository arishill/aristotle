Arishill Commerce
==============================

Arishill Commerce is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for production use, as most features are not in a complete workable state.

The goal of Arishill Commerce is to be an open source commerce platform for growing businesses. We aim to create something that is flexible and easy for developers to use.
We have a ways to go, but figured it useful to begin making our progress publicly available.

### Design Preview
Below is a sampling of designs of the dashboard, products index, and invoice edit page to give an idea of what's in store.

### Tech
Arishill Commerce is being built on NodeJS.

### Features
All functionality is handled in local meteor packages. These packages will potentially be broken out into separate repos in the future. Some features (and packages) currently in progress:

- Products
- Orders
- Invoices
- Reports
- Transactions
- Uploader
- Validation
- Coupons
- UI Components
- Tags
- Content (for general collections)

### History
The first version of Arishill Commerce was written in PHP back in 2011-2012. It is currently being used by several boutique clients.

This open source version of Arishill Commerce, will be built on the same premise, but is a complete re-design and re-write in NodeJS improving the first iteration in many ways.
